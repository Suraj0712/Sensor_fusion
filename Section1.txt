Sensors
1. Active (Lidar)
2. Passive (Camera)

Projects and courses
1. Lidar -> Obstacle detection in 3D
2. Camera -> Feature detection and tracking, data fusion between camera and Lidar sensor
3. Radar -> 
4. Kalman Filter -> BUilding unscented Kalman filter

Sensor fusion
-> Part of perception stack

Lidar 
-> Active sensor
-> Really good and reliable when it comes to distance measurements
-> Expensive
-> Point cloud processing and clustering algorithms required for data processing

Camera
-> Passive sensor
-> Returns high resolution data
-> neural network used for the object detection and tracking
-> Inexpensive

Radar
-> Active sensor
-> Signal processing is required in order to infer the required data from the sensor
-> Position -> Measured using the wave propagation
-> Velocity -> doplar effect
-> returns low resolution data
-> highly reliable and funcions in many different environments
-> Radar is inexpensive

Fusion
-> Merging th edata from multiple sensors to get comprehensive understanding of the environment
-> We designed the filters based on the prediction update cycle inorder to fuse the data from the different sensors
-> filter consideration includes determiningth enature of filter like whether it works in continuous or discrete space, how it handles the non linearity
-> Sensor provides the data in continuous form and generally filters works in discrete form.
